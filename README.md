Springboard
===========

##[Live Demo](http://jackstonedev.com/portfolio/springboard "Springboard")

Springboard is a collection of extremely lightweight CSS defaults and utility classes, easily extendable for your website, that will help jumpstart front-end design. Using it is simple; all you need is one line of code, like so:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/springboard.min.css" />`

Springboard requires a HTML5 doctype at the top of the page:

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

Since Springboard changes the *defaults* of a webpage, you can simply include the CSS file and watch as the browser styles are transformed. Also, different page widths are supported with responsive design, so your site will work on tablets and smartphones. Check out the example page on this repository, built completely using Springboard, as an example. Don't believe me? Look at the source!
